DOCKER INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
FROM 	   : from which platform to work on.
ENV		   : to define environment variables
RUN		   : to execute (updating,installing s/ws etc)
WORKDIR    : its like "cd". to change the directory.
COPY 	   : it takes in a src and destination. It only lets you copy in a local file or directory from your host into the Docker image itself. 
ADD        : same like copy. but it also supports tar files,urls to the specified directories.
				the best use for ADD is local tar file auto-extraction into the image if the tar file is available in local only.
CMD 	   : to execute the commands.
ENTRYPOINT : to execute the commands
difference between ENTRYPOINT & CMD is we can't override the ENTRYPOINT, whereas CMD will do.
Note: There is a way to override the ENTRYPOINT instruction - you need to add the --entrypoint flag prior to the container_name when running the command.
There are two types of forms.
1. Shell form
2. exec form
NOTE : recommended to use exec form to prevent potential performance issues.
Syntax for Shell form	: <instruction> <command>  Ex: CMD echo "vamshi"  (or) CMD ["echo","vamshi"]
Syntax for exec form	: <instruction> ["executable", "Parameter"]  Ex: ENTRYPOINT echo "vamshi" (or) ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "vamshi"]
